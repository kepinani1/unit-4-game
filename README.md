# unit-4-game

Objective of the Crystals Game:
1. Player clicks on one of four crystals, and a specified number of points will be added to the total score;
2. If the player's aggregated points match the randomly chosen score (i.e., computer's score), the player wins;
3. If the player's aggregated points do not match the randomly chosen score (i.e., computer's score), the player loses;

Other Considerations:
1. Crystal's values will be randomly generated and should be between 1-12;
2. Random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19-120;
3. Player aggregated values are properly added;
4. Game resets with each round of win or loss;

Technical Approach:
1. Ensure random generation of computer score;
2. Ensure random generation of crystal values;
3. Ensure aggregation of crytal values upon click;
4. Ensure proper if statement generation of computer and player input values in various scenarios (win, loss);
5. Ensure reset function of game in between rounds;

Challenges:
1. Resetting of game. I added coding for reseting the game, however, my reset function still did not work properly. This will be a part of the game that I will need to fix for the future.
